The InfoVis Toolkit is a Interactive Graphics Toolkit written in Java/Swing to ease the development of Information Visualization applications and components.

Its main characteristics are:
1) A unified data structure to manage large datasets quickly
2) A rich and extensible set of data structures and visualization components
3) A unified set of interactive components for filtering (a.k.a. dynamic queries) and Magic Lenses.
4) A small memory footprint
5) Fast: java graphics can be accelerated using the Agile2D package based on OpenGL.

Lots of cleanup and changes.
