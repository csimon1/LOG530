Global
	Add save
	Add global menus
	Add print/export image
	Check removing of controls (listeners not removed)
	Cleanup Columns classes / create a template.
	Add references to Algorithms.
	Add general string search
	Thread safety policy for monitoring
	Add a demo with all the visualizations
	Diffentiate internal columns and synthetic columns
		Use metadata / sync with IO to not save them
	Check desallocation of visualizations (listeners prevent it)
	Turn objects into Beans when that makes sense
		Visualizations
			PropertyChange
			BeanInfo for visual attributes
	Cleanup factories to all look the same, using a getInstance().
	Load/Save configurations
	Create a ruler layer for visualizations needing rulers
	Animate visualizations

Issues
	Should DefaultVisualization call the factories itself or should we
	provide an Infovis.initialize method to initialize visualizations
	with convenient defaults?

Examples
	Create a large set of examples structured by conference/year (e.g. InfoVis02)
	InfoVis02/03...

Columns
	Index columns for fast queries
	Two-stage indexing for dense columns
	Implement sparse columns
	Computed columns through scripting / JavaScript
	Add column visualizations
		Histograms
		TimeSketch
		Arc Diagrams
		Tile / Overlay / 

Tables
	Embed axis range sliders (create vertical rs)
	Traditional Tables / table lens
	Add column selection for Time Series

Trees
	Structural fisheyes (DOI [integrate])
	Hyperbolic trees

Graphs
	Finish searches

Panels
	Other dynamic query components
		Radio buttons
		Check boxes
		brushing histograms
	Range sliders
		Alpha-slider
		Overlaying of information on range sliders
		(1) display of values on both sides

IO
	Cleanup Readers and Writers
		Move Table{Reader,Writer} in table/io
		Provide an AbstractWriter
	Manage metadata in Writers/Readers
	Guess column types after loading them as strings to guess right
	When loading XML trees, don't leave the ROOT without attributes

Components
	Color editors for Color Visualizations
	Create sparse columns for loading XML/HTML files.
	
Graphics
	Stroked fonts
	GL vertex arrays as shapes (with Agile2D)
	HVC/Luv Lab/LCH color management

Visualization
	Add "rulers" for scales and so.
	Change <name>_COLUMN in visualization to COLUMN_<name> for consistency.
	Add links clipped by shapes in LinkVisualization

Excentric Labels
	Allow selection through labels by freezing them with shift
	      - needs change to LabelItem interface for selection

Fisheyes
	Create multi-foci fisheyes [integrate]

BUGS
	Range slider disappear under the scroll bar when it appears
