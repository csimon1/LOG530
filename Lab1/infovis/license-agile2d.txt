INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY NOTES

In this directory tree, we are releasing Agile2D to the interested
development community as Open Source code.

We are following an Open Source model to make sure that the
widest possible community has access to and builds on the Agile2D work.

Notes about Agile2D and Open Source: 

* If you download this code, you need to follow the Mozilla Public
  License (MPL). Please note that we are using MPL only as a legal
  framework for Agile2D to be released as Open Source code. It has nothing
  to do with Netscape or Netscape code.

* We are releasing this code only to the "interested development
  community." We do not plan to support or develop the code further, but
  believe that Agile2D may hold value for developers of graphical 
  applications. This license permits anyone to use Agile2D with any 
  applications they wish, including proprietary and legacy applications. 

* We have not done the checking that needs to be completed to
  satisfy section 3.4a (third party intellectual property
  claims). Anyone using the code does so at their own risk.

If you re-distribute this code, with or without modifications, then
one of the provisions of the Mozilla Public License, under which you
are using it, is to include the following statement (Exhibit A):

  Agile2D that infringe on third party's intellectual property protection such
  as patents.
