 	* New visualization for tables as matrix called ColumnsVisualization
	* New visualization for column called ColumnVisualization
	* Added DynamicTable, a table where elements can be added or removed
	* DefaultTree and graph Edge/Vertex tables are now DynamicTables
	* Graph is not a table anymore but contains two tables
	* A Table is now defined as a column of columns
	* Visualization has an iterator over all its visual columns
	* Added several layouts for node*link graph visualizations:
	circular, force*directed, plus new GraphViz fdp, circo, etc.
	* New graph algorithms available (Dijkstra etc.)
	* Added two layouts for node*link tree visualizations:
	simple and dendrogram
	* Added a JPanner to show thumbnails of visualizations and scroll
	* Control panels are now synchronized with visualization
	attributes: when the attributes change, they show the correct
	values
	* Control panels sub*panels for visual attributes are generater
	through a factory in infovis.panel.render
	* New Ruler framework: visualization can provide a table of rulers
	* More generalization of renderers
	* New item renderers: Area, ArrowHead, StrokingLable, Visualization
	* New datasets added: Infovis authors cocitation graph, films and homes tables
	* A new InfovisSet example showing all the visualizations at once

     * Rulers are introduced to show in the background of visualizations when that make sense.
     * Renderers are generalized for filtering, selection and fisheyes, for the best.
     * The license have changed: it is now the ultra-liberal X11/MIT license
     * Visualization components are split into several parts: interactors, layout and rendering items.  This split improves the modularity and extensibility of visualizations.
     * Visualizations can ask for a preferred size, allowing visualization panels to scroll.
     * More layouts are available: the new GraphViz 2 programs can be used (circo, fdp, etc.)  and an implementation of a dynamic graph layout is provided.
     * Lots of cleanup on internal structures: Factories are unified, Columns rely on Colt arrays.
     * Log4j is used for logging
     * Agile2D has been removed from the distribution and can be downloaded from elsewhere.
     * Many more details are improved.

	* src/infovis/panel/SplashPanel.java: idem
	* build.xml: stick to version 0.3beta1

	* TODO: Added tasks.
